# InternetMonitor
A little program to monitor internet uptime and reliability

This program runs in the tray and periodically attempts to ping three addresses:
  1) Your local router IP address
  2) A numeric IP address on the internet
  3) A name address on the internet

The results of these pings are appended to a log file. Clicking the Log File link will open the file with Notepad++.
